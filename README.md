# Homework-2

## Description

This was my first attempt at using CSS components provided by Bootstrap and applying them to my own websites. I was able to create a very basic responsive portofilio that will adjust based on the device that is used to view the webpage. 

## Installation

To install the repository just follow your basic ssh clone procedure and use whichever text editor you like. It is completely up to you!

## Things I learned

The grid system is intuitive and easy to use. I considered it much easier than creating a css page with floats in order to move images or content. I plan on continuing to play with bootstrap across all of my older projects to make them look better.
